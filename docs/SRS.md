# üìê Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the **SmartList** mobile application. SmartList enables families to collaboratively manage a shared grocery list with real-time syncing, offline capabilities, predictive suggestions, and budgeting tools.

### 1.2 Scope
SmartList is a mobile-first app designed for households with varying levels of tech literacy. It will allow up to 10 users to edit a shared shopping list, with features supporting smart item categorization, simplified UI, and offline reliability. The MVP will target Android and iOS smartphones only.

### 1.3 Intended Audience
- **Product Managers:** to verify scope
- **Design & Engineering Teams:** for implementation planning
- **QA Team:** to derive test cases
- **Stakeholders:** to understand delivery scope

### 1.4 Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Shared List | A collaborative list accessible by multiple users in real-time |
| Simple Mode | A streamlined UI optimized for accessibility and low-tech users |
| Quick Add | One-tap suggestion feature for frequent items |
| BaaS | Backend-as-a-Service (e.g., Firebase) |

---

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
SmartList will operate as a standalone mobile app built on a cloud-based backend with offline-first capabilities and real-time synchronization. It will not integrate with third-party APIs for pricing or grocery data in v1.

### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
| User Type           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Household Coordinator | Primary user managing most of the grocery planning |
| Secondary Users     | Family members (adults, teens, seniors) contributing to or consuming the list |
| Low-Tech Users      | Children or older adults using Simple Mode with minimal interaction complexity |
