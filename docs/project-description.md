# Sephora Accelerate

## Short description of the program

Sephora Accelerate is a brand incubation program dedicated to building a community of innovative, inspirational brand founders in beauty. With a focus on founders who are people of color, in line with our commitment to the 15 Percent Pledge, our goal is to ensure there are brands in the beauty industry representative of the colors, races, and ethnicities that make up the Americas.

Founders will embark on a six-month journey where they’ll gain the necessary skills to build and sustain a successful business through consistent, cohesive, and ongoing support backed by digital and in-person resources with content and curriculum directly correlated to helping founders succeed at Sephora.

In addition, brands will have the unique experience of building a heart-and-soul connection to our community and its ecosystem, as well as the opportunity of a lifetime—launching with Sephora, the world’s largest beauty retailer.
