# Task T12: Enable File Uploads with Size and Type Restrictions

Implement a robust file upload question type so admins can collect files from respondents while enforcing size and format rules. The upload control must integrate with the drag-and-drop form builder and preview mechanisms.

## Requirements

- **Component Implementation**
  - Create a reusable `FileUploadComponent` under `shared/components`.
  - The component must be **standalone** and use **on-push** change detection.
  - Accept inputs for `label`, `accept`, `maxSizeMB`, `multiple`, `required`, and `control`.
  - Use **signals** to track selected files and upload progress.
  - Provide both a clickable "Select Files" button and drag‑and‑drop zone.
  - Display each file’s name and size once chosen.
  - Validate that every file matches the allowed types and does not exceed the configured size limit.
  - Emit validation errors to the parent form when restrictions are violated.
  - Style the component exclusively with CSS custom properties.

- **Form Builder Integration**
  - Add an item in the form builder palette to insert a file upload question.
  - Configuration options must include:
    - Question label and help text.
    - Allowed file types (comma‑separated MIME types or extensions).
    - Maximum allowed size in megabytes.
    - Single vs. multiple file selection toggle.
    - Required toggle (ties into validation rules from **T06**).
  - Changes must immediately appear in the desktop and mobile preview panes (**T05**).
  - Persist all settings when saving drafts or publishing (**T07**).

- **User Experience**
  - Show clear validation messages for files that are too large or of an unsupported type.
  - Allow users to remove a chosen file before submission.
  - Ensure the control is fully usable with keyboard and screen readers.
  - Layout must adapt smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints (**T20**).

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests covering file selection, validation logic, and error states.
  - Include integration tests for uploading valid and invalid files in the form builder workflow.
  - Update e2e tests to cover submitting responses with file uploads.

## Deliverables

- `FileUploadComponent` source files and unit tests.
- Updated form builder UI supporting file upload questions.
- Documentation describing how to configure file uploads, including examples of size and type restrictions.
