# Task T13: Provide Video Uploads or Link Validation

Implement a video question type so admins can collect videos from respondents. The question should support either uploading a video file or supplying a link to an external video. Changes made in the builder must be previewed in real time and persist when forms are saved or published.

## Requirements

- **Component Implementation**
  - Create a reusable `VideoQuestionComponent` under `shared/components`.
  - The component must be **standalone** and use **on-push** change detection.
  - Accept inputs for `label`, `mode`, `accept`, `maxSizeMB`, `required`, and `control`.
    - `mode` can be `"upload"` or `"link"` and determines how the component behaves.
    - `accept` defaults to common video MIME types when `mode` is `"upload"`.
    - `control` should be a `FormControl<File | string>` bound to the parent form.
  - When in upload mode, reuse the `FileUploadComponent` from **T12** with video-specific validation.
  - When in link mode, display an input field for a URL and validate that the link is a wellâ€‘formed YouTube, Vimeo, or direct video URL.
  - Use **signals** to manage local state such as upload progress or the entered link.
  - Emit validation errors to the parent form whenever restrictions are violated.
  - Style the component exclusively with CSS custom properties.

- **Form Builder Integration**
  - Add an item in the drag-and-drop builder palette to insert a video question.
  - Configuration options must include:
    - Question label and help text.
    - Mode selection: Upload a file or provide a link.
    - Allowed file types and maximum size (only for upload mode).
    - Required toggle (ties into validation rules from **T06**).
  - Changes must instantly update the desktop and mobile preview panes (**T05**).
  - Persist all settings when saving drafts or publishing (**T07**).

- **User Experience**
  - Show a thumbnail preview for uploaded videos if possible, or display the validated link text.
  - Provide clear validation messages for unsupported formats, oversized files, or invalid links.
  - Ensure the control is keyboard accessible and responsive across breakpoints (**T20**).
  - Enforce role-based access so only admins can modify the question (**T08**).

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests covering both upload and link modes, including validation logic.
  - Include integration tests for configuring video questions in the form builder.
  - Update e2e tests to cover submitting forms with video uploads and video links.

## Deliverables

- `VideoQuestionComponent` source files and unit tests.
- Updated form builder UI supporting video questions.
- Documentation describing how to configure video uploads or link validation.
