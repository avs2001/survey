# Task Coverage Summary

This document reviews `task-01` through `task-14` from a front‑end perspective and determines how well they implement the features outlined in the PRD and SRS.

3. **ListService** – provides offline storage, real‑time synchronization and queueing of actions while offline. [task-03](task-03.md)
4. **List Overview Page** – shows existing lists and supports creation of new lists. [task-04](task-04.md)
5. **ItemService** – manages list items with IndexedDB persistence, WebSocket updates and offline queueing. [task-05](task-05.md)

14. **List Detail Page** – combines item list, form, category filter and suggestions. [task-14](task-14.md)

## Coverage Assessment

The tasks collectively address the core features specified in the PRD and SRS:

- **Offline functionality** – handled by the service worker, ListService and ItemService which queue actions while offline.
- **Real‑time synchronization** – ListService and ItemService subscribe to WebSocket updates and sync when back online.
- **Item categorization and suggestions** – CategoryService and SuggestionService provide category filtering and recommendations.
- **Notifications and reminders** – NotificationService manages push subscriptions and reminder preferences.
- **Accessibility and performance** – dedicated audit task ensures WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and performance budgets.

Earlier revisions lacked a page combining the item list, form, category filter and suggestion panel, and the routing configuration was unspecified. The newly added tasks – **Routing & Navigation** and **List Detail Page** – address these gaps and complete the front‑end plan.

Overall, tasks 01‑14 now cover all major front‑end functionality for the collaborative shopping list application.
