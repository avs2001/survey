# Task Coverage Summary

This document reviews `task-01` through `task-12` from a front‑end perspective and determines how well they implement the features outlined in the PRD and SRS.

## Overview of Tasks

1. **PWA Shell** – sets up an Angular 20 PWA with a service worker, connection status service and an offline banner. [task-01](task-01.md)
2. **Authentication** – implements login/signup pages, an AuthService with JWT storage and an HTTP interceptor. [task-02](task-02.md)
3. **ListService** – provides offline storage, real‑time synchronization and queueing of actions while offline. [task-03](task-03.md)
4. **List Overview Page** – shows existing lists and supports creation of new lists. [task-04](task-04.md)
5. **ItemService** – manages list items with IndexedDB persistence, WebSocket updates and offline queueing. [task-05](task-05.md)
6. **Item Form & Item List** – components to add, edit and display items grouped by category. [task-06](task-06.md)
7. **Category Service & Filter** – fetches categories and filters items by category. [task-07](task-07.md)
8. **Suggestion Service & Panel** – suggests frequently purchased items and allows quick addition. [task-08](task-08.md)
9. **Notification Service & Settings Page** – handles push permissions and reminder scheduling. [task-09](task-09.md)
10. **Sync Status Component** – visualizes connectivity and sync state in the header. [task-10](task-10.md)
11. **Accessibility & Performance Audit** – audits pages, resolves issues and adds automated checks. [task-11](task-11.md)
12. **End‑to‑End Testing** – Cypress tests for offline and real‑time scenarios. [task-12](task-12.md)

## Coverage Assessment

The tasks collectively address the core features specified in the PRD and SRS:

- **Offline functionality** – handled by the service worker, ListService and ItemService which queue actions while offline.
- **Real‑time synchronization** – ListService and ItemService subscribe to WebSocket updates and sync when back online.
- **Item categorization and suggestions** – CategoryService and SuggestionService provide category filtering and recommendations.
- **Notifications and reminders** – NotificationService manages push subscriptions and reminder preferences.
- **Accessibility and performance** – dedicated audit task ensures WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and performance budgets.

However, a dedicated page that composes the item list, form, category filter and suggestion panel (i.e. a **List Detail Page**) is not explicitly described. Task‑06 introduces the necessary components, but no task assembles them into a page. Router configuration and overall navigation beyond the header from task‑01 are also not spelled out. These areas may require additional tasks.

Overall, tasks 01‑12 cover nearly all front‑end functionality for the collaborative shopping list application, with the minor gap noted above regarding the List Detail page composition and navigation setup.
