# Applicant Questionnaire Interface

## Description
Create the user-facing interface where applicants complete the questionnaire. The form should dynamically display or hide questions based on the configured dependencies and enforce validations defined by administrators.

## Preconditions
- Questionnaire structure is defined by the administration interface.

## Potential Errors or Edge Cases
- Users navigating away mid-process may lose progress unless data is saved temporarily.
- Dependency rules misconfigured by administrators could cause questions to never appear.
