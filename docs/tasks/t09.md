# Task T09: Support Text Input (Short and Long)

Implement text input fields that allow respondents to enter short or long responses. The admin must be able to configure these questions in the form builder and preview them in real time.

## Requirements

- **Component Implementation**
  - Create a reusable `TextInputComponent` under `shared/components`.
  - The component must be **standalone** and use **on-push** change detection.
  - Accept inputs for `label`, `placeholder`, `required`, `rows`, and `maxLength`.
  - Render a standard `<input>` when `rows` is `1` (short text).
  - Render a `<textarea>` when `rows` is greater than `1` (long text).
  - Expose an `@Input() control: FormControl<string>` for reactive form binding.
  - Use **signals** for any local state, following the guidelines in `project.md`.
  - Style the component using CSS custom properties only.

- **Form Builder Integration**
  - Add an option in the drag-and-drop builder to insert a text input question.
  - Allow the admin to switch between short and long modes by setting the `rows` value.
  - Provide configuration fields for:
    - Question label and help text.
    - Placeholder text.
    - Required toggle.
    - Maximum character limit (ties into task T17).
  - Changes must immediately appear in the preview pane (T05).
  - Persist question settings when saving a draft or publishing (T07).

- **User Experience**
  - Display validation messages when required fields are empty or when the maximum length is exceeded.
  - Ensure the input styles respond well on mobile, tablet, and desktop (T20).
  - Respect role-based access rules so only admins can modify questions (T08).

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests covering both short and long input modes.
  - Include tests for validation logic and character limit enforcement.
  - Update e2e tests to cover creating and answering text questions.

## Deliverables

- `TextInputComponent` source and unit tests.
- Updated form builder UI supporting short and long text questions.
- Documentation describing how to configure text inputs in the admin interface.
