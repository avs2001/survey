# Task T10: Implement Radio Buttons, Checkboxes and Dropdowns

Implement single and multiple choice question types so admins can collect structured answers. Questions must be configurable in the form builder and immediately previewed in both desktop and mobile modes.

## Requirements

- **Component Implementation**
  - Create a reusable `SelectionQuestionComponent` in `shared/components`.
  - The component must be **standalone** with **on-push** change detection.
  - Accept inputs for `label`, `options`, `type`, `required`, and `control`.
    - `type` determines presentation: `radio`, `checkbox`, or `dropdown`.
    - `options` is an array of objects with `value` and `label` fields.
    - `control` should be an `FormControl<string | string[]>` bound to a reactive form.
  - Use **signals** for local state (e.g. tracking option order) as described in `project.md`.
  - Render:
    - A list of `<input type="radio">` elements for the radio option.
    - A list of `<input type="checkbox">` elements for the checkbox option.
    - A `<select>` element for the dropdown option.
  - Style the component exclusively with CSS custom properties.

- **Form Builder Integration**
  - Add a new item in the drag-and-drop builder to insert a selection question.
  - Allow the admin to choose between radio, checkbox, and dropdown presentation.
  - Provide configuration fields for:
    - Question label and help text.
    - Required toggle.
    - Option list management (add, remove, reorder choices).
    - Default selected value(s).
  - Ensure changes instantly update the preview pane (T05).
  - Persist all settings when saving as draft or publishing (T07).

- **User Experience**
  - Display validation messages when a required question is unanswered.
  - Ensure accessible markup with appropriate `aria` attributes.
  - Confirm controls adapt to mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints (T20).
  - Enforce role-based access so only admins can modify options (T08).

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests covering each selection mode and validation logic.
  - Include tests for adding and removing options in the form builder.
  - Update e2e tests to cover creating and answering selection questions.

## Deliverables

- `SelectionQuestionComponent` source files and unit tests.
- Updated form builder UI to create and configure selection questions.
- Documentation describing how to add radio, checkbox, and dropdown questions.
