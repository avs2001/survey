## Step 0.3: Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on these user stories (paste), generate a PRD including:
- Executive summary

```

**Deliverable:** `docs/PRD.md`

---

## Step 0.4: Generate Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Prompt:**

```text

```

**Deliverable:** `docs/SRS.md`

---

## Step 0.5: Generate Architecture & Diagrams

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on this SRS (paste), generate system architecture description and diagram (Mermaid format).

- `docs/architecture-diagram.mmd`

---

## Step 0.6: Break Down into Tasks

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on this SRS and architecture (paste), break the work into actionable tasks by:

- Backend
- Testing
- DevOps
Include: task title, description, priority, and type.
```

**Deliverable:** `docs/tasks.md` or GitHub Issues

# üîß Frontend Development Process (Angular 20 + Signals)

## Persona & Coding Style Guide

ü§ñ **AI Assist** ‚Äî When generating Angular code, use the following persona and style:

**Persona:**  
You are a dedicated Angular developer who thrives on leveraging the absolute latest features of the framework to build cutting-edge applications. You are currently immersed in Angular v20+, passionately adopting signals for reactive state management, embracing standalone components for streamlined architecture, and utilizing the new control flow for more intuitive template logic. Performance is paramount ‚Äî you constantly seek to optimize change detection and improve UX through modern Angular paradigms.

**References:**
- https://angular.dev/essentials/components
- https://angular.dev/essentials/signals
- https://angular.dev/essentials/templates
- https://angular.dev/essentials/dependency-injection
- https://angular.dev/style-guide
  **Important:**
- https://angular.dev/llms-full.txt

**Best Practices:**
- Always use standalone components
- Use signals + computed() for state
- Use native control flow (@if, @for)
- Prefer Reactive forms
- Avoid ngClass/ngStyle ‚Äî use `class` and `style` bindings
- Optimize change detection: OnPush
- Use inject() for services
- Lazy load feature routes
- Use NgOptimizedImage for static images

**Code Example:**

```ts
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, signal } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'example-root',
  templateUrl: 'example.html',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  protected readonly isServerRunning = signal(true);

  toggleServerStatus() {
    this.isServerRunning.update(isServerRunning => !isServerRunning);
  }
}
````

```html
<section class="container">
  @if (isServerRunning()) {
    <span>Yes, the server is running</span>
  } @else {
    <span>No, the server is not running</span>
  }
  <button (click)="toggleServerStatus()">Toggle Server Status</button>
</section>

```


## Step 1: Identify UI Screens and Components

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on this PRD and SRS (paste), list all required UI screens (pages) and their components.
Group them as:
- Page Name
- Purpose
- Required subcomponents
```

**Deliverable:** `docs/frontend-ui-map.md`

## Step 2: Generate Component Tree and File Structure

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on the list of screens and components (paste), generate a file/folder structure for Angular 20 using signals.
Include suggestions for:
- Pages
- Components
- Shared modules
- Feature modules
```

**Deliverable:** Folder layout in `/src/app/`

---

## Step 3: Scaffold First Feature (e.g., Login Page)

**Prompt:**

```text
Generate Angular 20 + Signals code for a Login Page with:
- Email/password fields
- Signal-based form state
- Submit button with validation
- Error handling signal
- Mock AuthService
```

**Deliverables:** `login.page.ts`, `login.page.html`, service & SCSS files

---

## Step 4: Style the Page (SCSS or Tailwind)

**Prompt:**

```text
Generate SCSS (or Tailwind classes) to style this page responsively.
Ensure proper spacing, alignment, and form layout.
```

**Deliverable:** `login.page.scss`

---

## Step 5: Add Tests

**Prompt:**

```text
Generate unit tests for LoginPage using Angular TestBed and Jest:
- Initial render
- Validation rules
- Submit behavior
- Error handling
```

**Deliverable:** `login.page.spec.ts`

---

## Step 6: Repeat for Next Feature

- Choose next priority feature (e.g., Dashboard, Signup)
- Repeat steps 1‚Äì5 per screen/component
- Use shared modules for UI elements like `Button`, `InputGroup`, `Modal`

---

## Step 7: Integrate API Connections (Optional for Later)

**Prompt:**

```text
Add Angular service integration to real API.
Replace mock AuthService with HttpClient-based POST.
Handle error response with signal.
```

---

## Step 8: Push & Track
