Based on this list of user needs (paste), generate clear User Stories in the format:
"As a <persona>, I want to <do something>, so that <goal>."
```

**Deliverable:** `docs/user-stories.md`

---

## Step 0.3: Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on these user stories (paste), generate a PRD including:
- Executive summary

```

**Deliverable:** `docs/PRD.md`

---

## Step 0.4: Generate Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on this PRD (paste), generate a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) including:

---

## Step 0.6: Break Down into Tasks

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on this SRS and architecture (paste), break the work into actionable tasks by:
- Frontend
- Backend
- Testing
- DevOps
Include: task title, description, priority, and type.
```

**Deliverable:** `docs/tasks.md` or GitHub Issues

# 🔧 Frontend Development Process (Angular 20 + Signals)

## Persona & Coding Style Guide

🤖 **AI Assist** — When generating Angular code, use the following persona and style:

**Persona:**  
You are a dedicated Angular developer who thrives on leveraging the absolute latest features of the framework to build cutting-edge applications. You are currently immersed in Angular v20+, passionately adopting signals for reactive state management, embracing standalone components for streamlined architecture, and utilizing the new control flow for more intuitive template logic. Performance is paramount — you constantly seek to optimize change detection and improve UX through modern Angular paradigms.

**References:**
- https://angular.dev/essentials/components
- https://angular.dev/essentials/signals
- https://angular.dev/essentials/templates
- https://angular.dev/essentials/dependency-injection
- https://angular.dev/style-guide
  **Important:**
- https://angular.dev/llms-full.txt

**Best Practices:**
- Always use standalone components
- Use signals + computed() for state
- Use native control flow (@if, @for)
- Prefer Reactive forms
- Avoid ngClass/ngStyle — use `class` and `style` bindings
- Optimize change detection: OnPush
- Use inject() for services
- Lazy load feature routes
- Use NgOptimizedImage for static images

**Code Example:**

```ts
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, signal } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'example-root',
  templateUrl: 'example.html',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  protected readonly isServerRunning = signal(true);

  toggleServerStatus() {
    this.isServerRunning.update(isServerRunning => !isServerRunning);
  }
}
````

```html
<section class="container">
  @if (isServerRunning()) {
    <span>Yes, the server is running</span>
  } @else {
    <span>No, the server is not running</span>
  }
  <button (click)="toggleServerStatus()">Toggle Server Status</button>
</section>

```


## Step 1: Identify UI Screens and Components

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on this PRD and SRS (paste), list all required UI screens (pages) and their components.
Group them as:
- Page Name
- Purpose
- Required subcomponents
```

**Deliverable:** `docs/frontend-ui-map.md`

## Step 2: Generate Component Tree and File Structure

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on the list of screens and components (paste), generate a file/folder structure for Angular 20 using signals.
Include suggestions for:
- Pages
- Components
- Shared modules
- Feature modules
```

**Deliverable:** Folder layout in `/src/app/`

---

## Step 3: Scaffold First Feature (e.g., Login Page)

**Prompt:**

```text
Generate Angular 20 + Signals code for a Login Page with:
- Email/password fields
- Signal-based form state
- Submit button with validation
- Error handling signal
- Mock AuthService
```

**Deliverables:** `login.page.ts`, `login.page.html`, service & SCSS files

---

## Step 4: Style the Page (SCSS or Tailwind)

**Prompt:**

```text
Generate SCSS (or Tailwind classes) to style this page responsively.
Ensure proper spacing, alignment, and form layout.
```

**Deliverable:** `login.page.scss`

---

## Step 5: Add Tests

**Prompt:**

```text
Generate unit tests for LoginPage using Angular TestBed and Jest:
- Initial render
- Validation rules
- Submit behavior
- Error handling
```

**Deliverable:** `login.page.spec.ts`

---

## Step 6: Repeat for Next Feature

- Choose next priority feature (e.g., Dashboard, Signup)
- Repeat steps 1–5 per screen/component
- Use shared modules for UI elements like `Button`, `InputGroup`, `Modal`

---

## Step 7: Integrate API Connections (Optional for Later)

**Prompt:**

```text
Add Angular service integration to real API.
Replace mock AuthService with HttpClient-based POST.
Handle error response with signal.
```

---

## Step 8: Push & Track

- Commit work with meaningful messages
- Track features with GitHub Issues, Linear, or a `docs/fe-tracking.md`
- Ask ChatGPT for refactoring or optimization

---

# 🔧 Backend Development Process

## Step 1: Identify Backend Services

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on the SRS and architecture, list all required backend services and responsibilities.
Group them as:

- Core logic or endpoint(s)
- Data models
```

**Deliverable:** `docs/backend-services.md`

---

## Step 2: Define Data Models and Schemas

**Prompt:**

```text
Based on SRS and feature requirements, define all data models.
Use TypeScript or JSON Schema notation.
```
