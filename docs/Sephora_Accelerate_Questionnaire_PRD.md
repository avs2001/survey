# Sephora Accelerate Program Questionnaire Platform  
**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

---

## Executive Summary

The Sephora Accelerate Program is an incubation initiative dedicated to empowering beauty brand founders, particularly founders of color, by providing them with access to education, mentorship, and a platform to launch their brands through Sephora.

To support this mission, we aim to develop a **dynamic questionnaire platform** to streamline and enhance the application experience for both applicants and program administrators.

The platform will enable administrators to configure flexible questionnaires with complex logic and validation, and will provide applicants with a smooth and intuitive way to submit structured data required for program selection.
