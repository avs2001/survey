# 🧭 Refined User Needs (v2)

## 👤 Primary Persona

**Household Coordinator**  
A parent or adult family member who ensures the home is stocked with essentials. They often serve as the planner and communicator within a household of four, managing logistics across varying tech comfort levels.

- **Primary device:** Mobile phone
- **List usage:** Shared by ~4 family members (adults + children)
- **Tech comfort range:** Mixed (some tech-savvy, some not)

---

## 😣 Pain Points

### Coordination friction between family members
- Multiple lists or poor visibility into shared needs cause errors.
- Users unknowingly duplicate items or forget who added what.
- No centralized ownership or roles (e.g., “main shopper”).

### Forgetting items during store visits
- Rushed visits often lead to skipped essentials.
- Lack of cues or prioritization leads to low recall.
- Users may forget to even open the list app.

### Connectivity drop-offs inside stores
- Supermarkets often have dead zones where Wi-Fi or mobile data fails.
- This results in list inaccessibility or sync failures mid-trip.

### Complex UIs limit participation
- Older users and children struggle with cluttered interfaces.
- Too many options obscure core tasks like “add item” or “mark as bought.”

### Frequent items re-added manually
- Weekly or daily staples must be retyped repeatedly.
- App lacks intelligence around recurring needs.

### No awareness of spending patterns
- Users can’t estimate or control weekly grocery costs.
- No insights into where the budget is going (e.g., snacks vs. essentials).
