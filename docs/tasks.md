# Development Tasks

The following tasks are derived from the [User Stories](user-stories.md), [PRD](PRD.md) and [SRS](SRS.md) documents. They are grouped by area of responsibility and provide technical details for implementation.

## Frontend

| Task Title | Description | Priority | Type |
|------------|-------------|----------|------|
| **PWA Shell** | Bootstrap an Angular&nbsp;20 application with a service worker for offline caching and IndexedDB storage. Ensure responsive layout for web and mobile. | High | Feature |
| **Authentication Screens** | Build login and signup pages using reactive forms. Connect to the `/users` API for account creation and store auth tokens for subsequent requests. | High | Feature |
| **List Overview Page** | Display shopping lists from `GET /lists`. Include "Add List" form using `POST /lists` and show an offline status indicator. | High | Feature |
| **List Detail Page** | Show items for a selected list via `GET /lists/{listId}/items`. Use WebSocket messages to update items in real time and persist changes locally when offline. | High | Feature |
| **Item Form & Editing** | Allow adding, editing and deleting items through `POST /lists/{listId}/items` and `PUT/DELETE /lists/{listId}/items/{itemId}`. Group items by category and support quantity and completion state. | High | Feature |
| **Category Filter** | Provide a view to filter items by aisle/section using the `categoryId` field. Update the list dynamically when categories change. | Medium | Feature |
| **Notification Settings** | Implement UI for push notification subscription and reminder scheduling. Integrate with the backend notification service. | Medium | Feature |
| **Item Suggestions Panel** | Display recommended items retrieved from the suggestion API. Use signals and `computed()` to update suggestions when the list changes. | Medium | Feature |
| **Accessibility & Performance** | Audit all components against WCAG&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;AA. Optimize change detection with `OnPush` and verify app loads under two seconds. | Medium | Enhancement |

## Backend

| Task Title | Description | Priority | Type |
|------------|-------------|----------|------|
| **User Endpoint** | Implement `POST /users` to register new accounts. Persist `name` and `email` as defined in the SRS schema and return a user token. | High | Feature |
| **List Endpoints** | Provide `GET /lists` and `POST /lists` for authenticated users. Store `name` and `createdAt` fields and return list data in JSON. | High | Feature |
| **Single List API** | Support `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE /lists/{listId}` for viewing, updating and removing lists. Ensure proper authorization checks. | High | Feature |
| **Item Endpoints** | Implement `GET /lists/{listId}/items`, `POST /lists/{listId}/items`, and `PUT/DELETE /lists/{listId}/items/{itemId}` for item management. | High | Feature |
| **WebSocket Sync** | Broadcast list and item changes to connected clients in real time. Persist updates to the database and notify offline clients on reconnection. | High | Feature |
| **Authentication Service** | Provide token-based auth (e.g., JWT). Secure all endpoints with HTTPS and verify user identity on each request. | High | Feature |
| **Item Suggestion API** | Expose an endpoint to return frequently purchased items based on past entries. Use historical item data to generate suggestions. | Medium | Feature |
| **Notification Service** | Send push notifications when items are added or reminders are due. Integrate with a third-party push provider. | Medium | Feature |
| **Data Model & Persistence** | Create database tables for users, lists, items, categories and notifications as shown in the SRS entity diagram. | Medium | Chore |

## Testing

| Task Title | Description | Priority | Type |
|------------|-------------|----------|------|
| **Frontend Unit Tests** | Cover Angular components, services and signals with tests. Mock WebSocket and HTTP calls. | High | Test |
| **Backend Unit Tests** | Test each API route and WebSocket handler. Validate authorization logic and error responses. | High | Test |
| **End-to-End Tests** | Simulate multiple clients to verify real-time synchronization, offline edits and cross-device behavior. | Medium | Test |
| **Performance Tests** | Measure initial load time (<2&nbsp;s) and sync latency (<1&nbsp;s) as required by the SRS. | Medium | Test |

## DevOps

| Task Title | Description | Priority | Type |
|------------|-------------|----------|------|
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Configure automated build, lint, test and deployment workflow. Produce versioned PWA builds and backend containers. | High | Chore |
| **Infrastructure Provisioning** | Use infrastructure as code to deploy the API, database and static site hosting. Include WebSocket and push notification services. | Medium | Chore |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | Collect backend metrics and client errors. Store logs centrally and expose health endpoints. | Medium | Chore |
| **Automated Backups** | Schedule recurring database backups and provide restore scripts. | Low | Chore |
